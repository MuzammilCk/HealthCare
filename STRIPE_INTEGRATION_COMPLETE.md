STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here

# Consultation Fee (in paise)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend

npm install
```

```

### 4. Test the System

## 💰 Currency Handling

### The Golden Rule: Everything in Paise

**Storage:** All amounts stored as integers in paise
```javascript
// Database
amount: 25000  // ₹250.00
```

**API Communication:** Always send/receive in paise
```javascript
// Request body
{ amount: 50000 }  // ₹500.00
```

**User Input:** Convert rupees to paise
```javascript
// Frontend
const rupeesToPaise = (rupees) => Math.round(parseFloat(rupees) * 100);
rupeesToPaise(250.00) // Returns 25000
```

**Display:** Convert paise to rupees
```javascript
// Frontend
const formatAmount = (paise) => `₹${(paise / 100).toFixed(2)}`;
formatAmount(25000) // Returns "₹250.00"
```
