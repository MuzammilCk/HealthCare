status: {

## User Experience Improvements

### For Doctors:
1. **Better appointment management** - Can now handle patient no-shows, emergencies, and scheduling conflicts
2. **Accountability tracking** - Missed appointments are recorded in patient files
3. **Flexible scheduling** - Can reschedule appointments when needed
4. **Clear rejection process** - Must provide reason when rejecting appointments
5. **Hospital association** - Required during registration for better organization

### For Patients:
1. **Transparency** - Receive notifications for all appointment changes
2. **Accountability** - Missed appointments are tracked (incentive to cancel in advance)
3. **Better communication** - Know why appointments are rejected/rescheduled
4. **Avoid penalties** - Can cancel appointments to avoid "missed" marks

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test missed appointment marking:**
   - Try marking future appointments (should fail)
   - Try marking past appointments (should succeed)
   - Verify patient's missedAppointments count increments

2. **Test appointment rejection:**
   - Verify reason is required
   - Check patient receives notification with reason
   - Verify appointment status changes to 'Rejected'

3. **Test appointment rescheduling:**
   - Verify new slot availability check works
   - Check patient receives notification with old and new details
   - Test with conflicting time slots (should fail)

4. **Test doctor registration:**
   - Try registering without hospital (should fail)
   - Verify hospital dropdown filters by district
   - Check doctor profile shows hospital details

5. **Test follow-up removal:**
   - Verify follow-up buttons are removed
   - Check prescription creation only works with 'Completed' status
   - Ensure no follow-up routes are accessible

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Data:

1. **Existing users** - Will have `missedAppointments: 0` by default
2. **Existing appointments** - No 'Follow-up' status appointments should remain
3. **Existing doctors** - May have `hospitalId: null` (needs migration script if strict validation is enforced)

### Recommended Migration Script:
```javascript
// Update all users to have missedAppointments field
db.users.updateMany(
  { missedAppointments: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { missedAppointments: 0 } }
);

// Update any Follow-up appointments to Completed
db.appointments.updateMany(
  { status: 'Follow-up' },
  { $set: { status: 'Completed' } }
);
```
