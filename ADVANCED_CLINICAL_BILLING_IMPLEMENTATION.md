### ✅ Part 2: Backend API Implementation

#### 2.1 Smart Prescription Controller
- **Location**: `backend/controllers/doctors.js`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/doctors/prescriptions`
- **Features**:
  - Accepts two types of medicines:
    - `billedMedicines`: From hospital inventory (will be billed)
    - `prescribedOnlyMedicines`: Free-form prescriptions (not billed)
  - Validates appointment eligibility
  - Checks `prescriptionGenerated` flag (one-time action)
  - Performs **CHECK 1**: Initial inventory stock availability
  - Creates prescription with both medicine types
  - Auto-generates bill if billed medicines exist
  - Sets `prescriptionGenerated` and `finalBillGenerated` flags
  - Sends notifications to patient

**Request Payload Example**:
```json
{
  "appointmentId": "...",
  "billedMedicines": [
    {
      "medicineName": "Paracetamol",
      "dosage": "500mg",
      "frequency": "Twice daily",
      "duration": "5 days",
      "quantity": 10,
      "instructions": "After meals"
    }
  ],
  "prescribedOnlyMedicines": [
    {
      "medicineName": "Vitamin D3",
      "dosage": "60000 IU",
      "frequency": "Once weekly",
      "duration": "8 weeks",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "diagnosis": "Viral fever",
  "notes": "Rest and hydration advised",
  "consultationFee": 50000,
  "generateBill": true
}
```

#### 2.2 Inventory Search API
- **Location**: `backend/controllers/inventory.js`
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/inventory/search?query=medicine`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time search of doctor's hospital inventory
  - Returns medicine name, price, stock status
  - Used by prescription creation UI

#### 2.3 Patient File View API
- **Location**: `backend/controllers/patients.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/patients/search?query=name` - Search patients
  - `GET /api/v1/patients/:patientId/file` - Get complete patient file
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive patient data aggregation
  - Includes: personal details, medical history, appointments, prescriptions, bills
  - Statistics: total appointments, completed, prescriptions count, unpaid bills
  - Only accessible to doctors
  - Only shows patients who have had appointments with the requesting doctor

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "patient": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "email": "..." },
    "medicalHistory": { "bloodType": "...", "allergies": [...] },
    "appointments": {
      "total": 10,
      "upcoming": 2,
      "completed": 7,
      "cancelled": 1,
      "data": [...]
    },
    "prescriptions": { "total": 5, "data": [...] },
    "bills": {
      "total": 5,
      "unpaid": 1,
      "paid": 4,
      "totalUnpaidAmount": 50000,
      "data": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2.4 Two-Step Inventory Check & Payment
- **Location**: `backend/controllers/mockPayments.js`
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/mock-payments/verify`
- **Features**:
  - **CHECK 1**: At prescription/bill creation - validates stock availability
  - **CHECK 2**: At payment - re-validates stock before processing
  - Only reduces inventory stock AFTER successful payment
  - Prevents race conditions and overselling
  - Returns error if stock becomes unavailable between checks

**Payment Flow**:
1. Doctor creates prescription → CHECK 1 (stock available?)
2. Bill generated with inventory item IDs stored
3. Patient clicks "Pay Now" → CHECK 2 (stock still available?)
4. Payment successful → Reduce stock from inventory
5. Bill marked as paid

#### Issue: Floating-point errors in calculations
**Solution**: All monetary values stored as integers (paise)

#### Issue: Doctor can create multiple bills
**Solution**: `finalBillGenerated` flag prevents duplicates
