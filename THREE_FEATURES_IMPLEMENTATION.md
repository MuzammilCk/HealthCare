1. **Payment & Billing System (Mock)**
2. **Appointment Cancellation & Refund Policy**
3. **Secure Medical History Workflow**

All features are fully implemented and ready for testing.

---

## Feature 1: Payment & Billing System (Mock)

### ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

The mock payment system is fully implemented with all monetary values handled as integers in paise.

### Backend Components

**Models:**
- ✅ `Payment.js` - Stores all payment transactions (amounts in paise)
- ✅ `Bill.js` - Stores medical bills with line items (amounts in paise)
- ✅ `Appointment.js` - Updated with `bookingFeeStatus` field
- ✅ `Prescription.js` - Updated with `price` field (in paise)

**Controllers:**
- ✅ `mockPayments.js` - Mock payment logic
  - `createMockBookingOrder` - Creates fake order for booking fee
  - `createMockBillOrder` - Creates fake order for bill payment
  - `verifyMockPayment` - Auto-verifies payment and updates status
  - `getPatientPayments` - Retrieves payment history
  - `getPaymentByOrderId` - Gets payment details

**Routes:**
- ✅ `POST /api/mock-payments/create-booking-order` - Create booking order
- ✅ `POST /api/mock-payments/create-bill-order` - Create bill order
- ✅ `POST /api/mock-payments/verify-payment` - Verify payment
- ✅ `GET /api/mock-payments/history` - Get payment history
- ✅ `GET /api/mock-payments/order/:orderId` - Get payment by order ID

### Frontend Components

**Pages:**
- ✅ `BookAppointment.jsx` - Integrated mock payment flow
- ✅ `Bills.jsx` - Bills dashboard with payment
- ✅ `PaymentSuccess.jsx` - Payment confirmation page
- ✅ `PaymentCancelled.jsx` - Payment cancellation page
- ✅ `GenerateBill.jsx` - Doctor's bill creation form

### Payment Flow

```
1. User Action → Click "Proceed to Payment" or "Pay Now"
2. Create Mock Order → POST /api/mock-payments/create-booking-order
   - Backend generates fake order ID
   - Creates pending Payment record
   - Returns order details instantly
3. Simulate Processing → Frontend shows loading (1.5 seconds)
4. Auto-Verify Payment → POST /api/mock-payments/verify-payment
   - Backend updates Payment status to 'completed'
   - Updates Appointment/Bill status to 'paid'
   - Sends notifications
5. Success Page → Redirect to /payment-success?order_id=xxx
```

### Currency Handling

**All amounts in paise (smallest currency unit):**

```javascript
// Storage
amount: 25000  // ₹250.00 in paise

// Frontend Input (user enters rupees)
const rupeesToPaise = (rupees) => Math.round(parseFloat(rupees) * 100);
rupeesToPaise(250.00) // Returns 25000

// Frontend Display (convert paise to rupees)
const formatAmount = (paise) => `₹${(paise / 100).toFixed(2)}`;
formatAmount(25000) // Returns "₹250.00"
```

### Testing

1. **Book Appointment:**
   - Select doctor, date, time
   - Click "Proceed to Payment"
   - Payment auto-completes after 1.5 seconds
   - Appointment status updated to 'paid'

2. **Generate Bill:**
   - Doctor marks appointment as completed
   - Clicks "Generate Bill"
   - Adds items (amounts in rupees, converted to paise)
   - Submits bill

3. **Pay Bill:**
   - Patient goes to "Bills & Payments"
   - Clicks "Pay Now"
   - Payment auto-completes
   - Bill status updated to 'paid'

---

## Feature 2: Appointment Cancellation & Refund Policy

### ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Policy Rule

**If a patient cancels more than 3 days in advance, they receive a 50% refund.**

### Backend Implementation

**Model Updates:**
- ✅ `Appointment.js` - Added statuses:
  - `'cancelled_refunded'` - Cancelled with 50% refund
  - `'cancelled_no_refund'` - Cancelled without refund

**Controller:**
- ✅ `cancelAppointment` in `patients.js`
  - Validates appointment ownership
  - Calculates days until appointment
  - Determines refund eligibility
  - Creates mock refund payment if eligible
  - Updates appointment status
  - Sends notifications

**Route:**
- ✅ `POST /api/patients/appointments/:id/cancel`

### Cancellation Logic

```javascript
// Calculate days until appointment
const now = new Date();
const appointmentDate = new Date(appointment.date);
const daysUntilAppointment = Math.ceil((appointmentDate - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

// Determine refund eligibility
const isRefundEligible = daysUntilAppointment > 3;

if (isRefundEligible) {
  // 50% refund
  const consultationFee = 25000; // paise
  const refundAmount = Math.floor(consultationFee * 0.5); // 12500 paise = ₹125
  
  // Create refund payment record
  const refundPayment = new Payment({
    paymentType: 'refund',
    amount: refundAmount,
    status: 'completed',
    metadata: {
      reason: 'Appointment cancelled more than 3 days in advance',
      refundPercentage: 50,
      originalAmount: consultationFee
    }
  });
  
  appointment.status = 'cancelled_refunded';
} else {
  appointment.status = 'cancelled_no_refund';
}
```

### API Response

**With Refund:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Appointment cancelled successfully. 50% refund processed.",
  "refundEligible": true,
  "refundAmount": 12500,
  "refundPercentage": 50
}
```

**Without Refund:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Appointment cancelled. No refund eligible (less than 3 days notice).",
  "refundEligible": false,
  "daysUntilAppointment": 2
}
```

### Testing

1. **Cancel with Refund:**
   - Book appointment 5+ days in future
   - Pay booking fee
   - Cancel appointment
   - Verify 50% refund payment record created
   - Status: `cancelled_refunded`

2. **Cancel without Refund:**
   - Book appointment 1-2 days in future
   - Pay booking fee
   - Cancel appointment
   - No refund payment created
   - Status: `cancelled_no_refund`

3. **Cancel Unpaid Appointment:**
   - Book appointment (don't pay)
   - Cancel appointment
   - Status: `cancelled_no_refund`
   - No refund (nothing was paid)

## Feature 3: Secure Medical History Workflow

### ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Architecture Changes

**Model Refactored:**
- ✅ `MedicalHistory.js` - Complete restructure with:
  - Structured sub-schemas (allergies, conditions, medications, surgeries, family history)
  - Audit fields (`createdBy`, `lastUpdatedBy`)
  - Correction request fields
  - Lifestyle information
  - Timestamps enabled

### Structured Data Schema

```javascript
// Allergy Schema
{
  name: String,
  severity: 'mild' | 'moderate' | 'severe',
  reaction: String,
  diagnosedDate: Date
}

// Condition Schema
{
  name: String,
  diagnosedDate: Date,
  status: 'active' | 'resolved' | 'chronic',
  notes: String
}

// Medication Schema
{
  name: String,
  dosage: String,
  frequency: String,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  prescribedBy: String
}

// Surgery Schema
{
  name: String,
  date: Date,
  hospital: String,
  notes: String
}

// Family History Schema
{
  condition: String,
  relationship: String,
  notes: String
}
```

### Audit Fields

```javascript
{
  createdBy: ObjectId, // Doctor/Admin who created
  lastUpdatedBy: ObjectId, // Doctor/Admin who last updated
  createdAt: Date, // Auto-generated
  updatedAt: Date, // Auto-generated
}
```

### Correction Request System

```javascript
{
  correctionRequested: Boolean,
  correctionRequestMessage: String,
  correctionRequestDate: Date
}
```

### Backend Implementation

**Controller:**
- ✅ `medicalHistory.js`
  - `getOwnMedicalHistory` - Patient read-only access
  - `requestCorrection` - Patient requests correction
  - `getPatientMedicalHistory` - Doctor/Admin access
  - `updatePatientMedicalHistory` - Doctor/Admin updates

**Routes:**
- ✅ `GET /api/medical-history/me` - Patient read-only
- ✅ `POST /api/medical-history/me/request-correction` - Patient requests correction
- ✅ `GET /api/medical-history/patient/:patientId` - Doctor/Admin view
- ✅ `PUT /api/medical-history/patient/:patientId` - Doctor/Admin update

### Security

**Access Control:**
- ✅ Patients: Read-only access to their own medical history
- ✅ Patients: Can request corrections
- ✅ Doctors: Full read/write access to patient medical histories
- ✅ Admins: Full read/write access to all medical histories

**Route Protection:**
```javascript
// Patient routes - Read only
router.get('/me', restrictTo('patient'), getOwnMedicalHistory);
router.post('/me/request-correction', restrictTo('patient'), requestCorrection);

// Doctor/Admin routes - Full access
router.get('/patient/:patientId', restrictTo('doctor', 'admin'), getPatientMedicalHistory);
router.put('/patient/:patientId', restrictTo('doctor', 'admin'), updatePatientMedicalHistory);
```

### Workflow

**Patient View:**
1. Patient views medical history (read-only)
2. If incorrect, clicks "Request a Correction"
3. Enters correction message
4. System sets `correctionRequested = true`
5. Notification sent to doctor/admin

**Doctor/Clinician View:**
1. Doctor accesses patient's medical history
2. Sees correction request if pending
3. Updates medical history with correct information
4. System clears correction request
5. Sets `lastUpdatedBy` to doctor's ID
6. Notification sent to patient

### Testing

1. **Patient Read-Only Access:**
   - Login as patient
   - View medical history
   - Verify cannot edit directly

2. **Request Correction:**
   - Click "Request a Correction"
   - Enter message
   - Submit request
   - Verify notification sent

3. **Doctor Updates:**
   - Login as doctor
   - Access patient's medical history
   - Update fields
   - Save changes
   - Verify `lastUpdatedBy` updated
   - Verify patient notified
