### Backend API Endpoints

**Already Existed:**

## âœ… Feature 3: Limit Bookings with Pending Dues - COMPLETE

### Backend Implementation

**Added Check in Booking Flow:**
```javascript
// In createMockBookingOrder controller
const unpaidBillsCount = await Bill.countDocuments({
  patientId,
  status: 'unpaid'
});

if (unpaidBillsCount >= 2) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    success: false, 
    message: 'You must clear your pending dues to book further appointments. You have ' + unpaidBillsCount + ' unpaid bills.' 
  });
}
```

**Logic:**
- Counts unpaid bills for patient
- If count >= 2, blocks booking
- Returns clear error message
- Patient must pay bills to continue

### Frontend Handling

**Error Display:**
- Frontend already handles error messages
- Shows toast notification with error
- User sees: "You must clear your pending dues to book further appointments"
- Can navigate to Bills page to pay

**Flow:**
```
1. Patient tries to book appointment
2. Backend checks unpaid bills count
3. If >= 2: Return error
4. Frontend shows error toast
5. Patient goes to Bills page
6. Pays pending bills
7. Can now book appointments
```
