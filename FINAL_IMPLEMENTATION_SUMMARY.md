amount: 25000  // â‚¹250.00 in paise

// Frontend Input (user enters rupees)
const rupeesToPaise = (rupees) => Math.round(parseFloat(rupees) * 100);
rupeesToPaise(250.00) // Returns 25000

// Frontend Display (convert paise to rupees)
const formatAmount = (paise) => `â‚¹${(paise / 100).toFixed(2)}`;
formatAmount(25000) // Returns "â‚¹250.00"
```
