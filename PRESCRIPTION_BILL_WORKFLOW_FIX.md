# Prescription to Bill Workflow - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prescription Creation Not Redirecting to Bill View
**Problem:** After creating a prescription with billed medicines, the system was navigating back to appointments instead of showing the generated bill.

**Solution:** Modified `CreatePrescriptionNew.jsx` to redirect to the bill view page when a bill is generated.

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/pages/doctor/CreatePrescriptionNew.jsx`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
if (res.data.data.billGenerated) {
  toast.success('Prescription created and bill generated successfully!');
} else {
  toast.success('Prescription created successfully!');
}
navigate('/doctor/appointments');

// After
if (res.data.data.billGenerated && res.data.data.bill) {
  toast.success('Prescription created and bill generated successfully!');
  // Redirect to bill view
  navigate(`/doctor/bills/${res.data.data.bill._id}`);
} else {
  toast.success('Prescription created successfully!');
  navigate('/doctor/appointments');
}
```

### 2. View Bill Button Not Working in Appointments
**Problem:** The "View Bill" button in the appointments page was trying to fetch bills using the wrong endpoint and wasn't finding the bills.

**Solution:** 
1. Updated the backend `getDoctorBills` controller to support filtering by `appointmentId`
2. Updated the frontend to use the correct endpoint `/bills/doctor` with query parameters

**Backend Changes:** `backend/controllers/bills.js`
```javascript
// Added appointmentId query parameter support
exports.getDoctorBills = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const doctorId = req.user.id;
    const { status, appointmentId } = req.query;  // Added appointmentId

    const query = { doctorId };
    if (status) {
      query.status = status;
    }
    if (appointmentId) {
      query.appointmentId = appointmentId;  // Filter by appointment
    }

    const bills = await Bill.find(query)
      .populate('patientId', 'name email')
      .populate('appointmentId', 'date timeSlot')
      .sort({ createdAt: -1 });

    res.json({ success: true, data: bills });  // Changed to 'data' for consistency
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching doctor bills:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: 'Failed to fetch bills' });
  }
};
```

**Frontend Changes:** `frontend/src/pages/doctor/Appointments.jsx`
```javascript
// Desktop view - Updated endpoint
const res = await api.get('/bills/doctor', {  // Changed from '/bills'
  params: { appointmentId: appointment._id } 
});

// Mobile view - Same update
const res = await api.get('/bills/doctor', {  // Changed from '/bills'
  params: { appointmentId: appointment._id } 
});
```
