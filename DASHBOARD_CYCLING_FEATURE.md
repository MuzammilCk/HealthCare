# Dashboard Appointment Cycling Feature - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Feature Implemented

**Enhancement:** Stat cards on doctor dashboard now cycle through appointments when clicked.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Scheduled Appointments Card (Orange)**
- **First Click:** Jumps to 1st scheduled appointment
- **Second Click:** Jumps to 2nd scheduled appointment  
- **Third Click:** Jumps to 3rd scheduled appointment
- **After Last:** Cycles back to 1st appointment

### **Completed Appointments Card (Green)**
- **First Click:** Jumps to most recent completed appointment
- **Second Click:** Jumps to 2nd most recent
- **Third Click:** Jumps to 3rd most recent
- **After Last:** Cycles back to most recent

### **Today's Appointments Card (Blue)**
- **Always:** Jumps to today's date

## 📝 Implementation Details

### File: `frontend/src/pages/doctor/Dashboard.jsx`

### 1. **State Management**
```javascript
const [scheduledIndex, setScheduledIndex] = useState(0);
const [completedIndex, setCompletedIndex] = useState(0);
```

### 2. **Scheduled Cycling Logic**
```javascript
const handleScheduledClick = () => {
  // Get all scheduled appointments sorted by date
  const scheduledApts = appointments
    .filter(a => a.status === 'Scheduled')
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date));
  
  if (scheduledApts.length > 0) {
    // Cycle through scheduled appointments
    const nextIndex = scheduledIndex % scheduledApts.length;
    const selectedApt = scheduledApts[nextIndex];
    const aptDate = new Date(selectedApt.date);
    
    setSelectedDate(aptDate);
    setCurrentMonth(aptDate);
    setScheduledIndex(nextIndex + 1); // Move to next for next click
  }
};
```

### 3. **Completed Cycling Logic**
```javascript
const handleCompletedClick = () => {
  // Get all completed appointments sorted by date (most recent first)
  const completedApts = appointments
    .filter(a => a.status === 'Completed')
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date));
  
  if (completedApts.length > 0) {
    // Cycle through completed appointments
    const nextIndex = completedIndex % completedApts.length;
    const selectedApt = completedApts[nextIndex];
    const aptDate = new Date(selectedApt.date);
    
    setSelectedDate(aptDate);
    setCurrentMonth(aptDate);
    setCompletedIndex(nextIndex + 1); // Move to next for next click
  }
};
```

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

### **Disabled State**
- Cards are disabled when count is 0
- Grayed out appearance
- Text changes to "No appointments"
- Cannot be clicked

### **Active State**

- "Click to cycle" text
- Arrow indicator

### **Text Updates**
```javascript

{stats.scheduled > 0 ? 'Click to cycle' : 'No appointments'}

// Completed Card  
{stats.completed > 0 ? 'Click to cycle' : 'No appointments'}
```

## 📊 Example Flow

### Scenario: 5 Scheduled Appointments

**Appointments:**
1. Jan 15 - Dr. Smith
2. Jan 20 - Dr. Johnson
3. Jan 25 - Dr. Williams
4. Feb 1 - Dr. Brown
5. Feb 5 - Dr. Davis

**Click Sequence:**
- **Click 1:** Calendar jumps to Jan 15
- **Click 2:** Calendar jumps to Jan 20
- **Click 3:** Calendar jumps to Jan 25
- **Click 4:** Calendar jumps to Feb 1
- **Click 5:** Calendar jumps to Feb 5
- **Click 6:** Calendar jumps back to Jan 15 (cycle restarts)

---

## 🔄 Cycling Behavior

### Modulo Operation
```javascript
const nextIndex = scheduledIndex % scheduledApts.length;
```

**Example with 3 appointments:**
- scheduledIndex = 0 → nextIndex = 0 (1st appointment)
- scheduledIndex = 1 → nextIndex = 1 (2nd appointment)
- scheduledIndex = 2 → nextIndex = 2 (3rd appointment)
- scheduledIndex = 3 → nextIndex = 0 (back to 1st)
- scheduledIndex = 4 → nextIndex = 1 (2nd again)

---

## 🎯 Sorting Logic

### Scheduled Appointments
```javascript
.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date))
```
- **Ascending order** (earliest first)
- Cycles from nearest to farthest future appointment

### Completed Appointments
```javascript
.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date))
```
- **Descending order** (most recent first)
- Cycles from most recent to oldest

- Automatically loops back to start
- Maintains position across re-renders
