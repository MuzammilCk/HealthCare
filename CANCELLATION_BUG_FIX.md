# Cancellation Bug - FIXED ✅

## Problem

When cancelling an appointment:
- ❌ Frontend showed "Failed to cancel appointment"
- ✅ Appointment was actually cancelled (visible after refresh)
- ❌ Refund amount not displayed
- ❌ Had to refresh or try again to see status

## Root Cause

The `createNotification` function was being called with **incorrect parameters**.

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
createNotification(userId, message, link, type, metadata)
```

**Was Being Called As:**
```javascript
createNotification({
  userId: patientId,
  type: 'refund_processed',
  message: `...`,
  relatedId: appointment._id,
  relatedModel: 'Appointment'
})
```

This caused the notification creation to throw an error, which was caught by the try-catch block, preventing the success response from being sent to the frontend.

## Solution

Fixed all `createNotification` calls in the cancellation function to use correct parameters:

**Before:**
```javascript
await createNotification({
  userId: patientId,
  type: 'refund_processed',
  message: `50% refund processed`,
  ...
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
await createNotification(
  patientId,
  `50% refund processed for cancelled appointment`,
  `/patient/bills`,
  'refund'
);
```

## Changes Made

### File: `backend/controllers/patients.js`

**Fixed 5 notification calls:**

1. **Unpaid appointment cancellation:**
   ```javascript
   await createNotification(
     appointment.doctorId._id,
     `Appointment cancelled by patient`,
     `/doctor/appointments`,
     'appointment'
   );
   ```

2. **Refund eligible - Patient notification:**
   ```javascript
   await createNotification(
     patientId,
     `50% refund processed for cancelled appointment`,
     `/patient/bills`,
     'refund'
   );
   ```

3. **Refund eligible - Doctor notification:**
   ```javascript
   await createNotification(
     appointment.doctorId._id,
     `Appointment cancelled by patient (refunded)`,
     `/doctor/appointments`,
     'appointment'
   );
   ```

4. **No refund - Patient notification:**
   ```javascript
   await createNotification(
     patientId,
     `Appointment cancelled. No refund (less than 3 days notice)`,
     `/patient/appointments`,
     'appointment'
   );
   ```

5. **No refund - Doctor notification:**
   ```javascript
   await createNotification(
     appointment.doctorId._id,
     `Appointment cancelled by patient (no refund)`,
     `/doctor/appointments`,
     'appointment'
   );
   ```
