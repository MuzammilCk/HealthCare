# Dynamic Consultation Fee & Bug Fixes - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

Two major improvements have been implemented:
1. **Dynamic Consultation Fee** - Doctors can set their own fees
2. **Cancellation Bug Fix** - Refunds now process correctly
3. **Payment Failure Simulation** - Test both success and failure scenarios

---

## Feature 1: Dynamic Consultation Fee ✅

### Problem
- Consultation fee was hardcoded to ₹250 for all doctors
- No way for doctors to set their own rates
- Patients couldn't see the fee before booking

### Solution Implemented

#### Backend Changes

**1. Doctor Model Updated (`Doctor.js`):**
```javascript
consultationFee: { 
  type: Number, 
  required: true, 
  default: 25000,  // ₹250 in paise
  min: 0,
  comment: 'Consultation fee in paise'
}
```

**2. New API Endpoint:**
- `PUT /api/doctors/profile` - Update doctor profile including consultation fee

**3. Payment Controllers Updated:**
- `createMockBookingOrder` - Fetches doctor's fee from profile
- `verifyMockPayment` - Uses doctor's fee for payment creation
- `cancelAppointment` - Uses doctor's fee for refund calculation

#### Frontend Changes

**1. Booking Page (`BookAppointment.jsx`):**
- Displays doctor's consultation fee in appointment summary
- Shows fee in payment confirmation dialog
- Converts paise to rupees for display

**2. Doctor Profile Page (To be added):**
- Input field for setting consultation fee
- Converts rupees to paise before saving
- Real-time preview of fee

### How It Works

```
1. Doctor sets consultation fee in profile (e.g., ₹500)
   → Frontend converts to paise (50000)
   → Saved to database

2. Patient books appointment
   → Frontend fetches doctor profile with fee
   → Displays: "Consultation Fee: ₹500.00"

3. Payment processing
   → Backend fetches doctor's fee (50000 paise)
   → Creates payment order with correct amount
   → Patient pays doctor's specific fee

4. Refund calculation
   → Uses doctor's fee for 50% refund
   → Example: ₹500 fee → ₹250 refund
```

### API Changes

**Create Order:**
```javascript
// Backend now fetches doctor's fee
const doctorProfile = await Doctor.findOne({ userId: doctorId });
const consultationFee = doctorProfile.consultationFee || 25000;
```

**Verify Payment:**
```javascript
// Uses doctor's fee for payment record
const doctorProfile = await Doctor.findOne({ userId: doctorId });
const consultationFee = doctorProfile?.consultationFee || 25000;
```

**Cancel Appointment:**
```javascript
// Uses doctor's fee for refund
const doctorProfile = await Doctor.findOne({ userId: appointment.doctorId });
const consultationFee = doctorProfile?.consultationFee || 25000;
const refundAmount = Math.floor(consultationFee * 0.5);
```

---

## Feature 2: Cancellation Bug Fix ✅

### Problem
- Frontend showed "Failed to cancel appointment"
- BUT appointment was actually cancelled in database
- No refund payment record was created
- Error occurred during refund creation

### Root Cause
The cancellation controller was trying to create a refund payment but:
1. Missing required fields in Payment model
2. Using hardcoded consultation fee instead of doctor's fee
3. Error caused controller to return failure response
4. Appointment was already updated before error occurred

### Solution Implemented

**Fixed `cancelAppointment` Controller:**
```javascript
// Now fetches doctor's fee correctly
const Doctor = require('../models/Doctor');
const doctorProfile = await Doctor.findOne({ userId: appointment.doctorId });
const consultationFee = doctorProfile?.consultationFee || 25000;
const refundAmount = Math.floor(consultationFee * 0.5);

// Creates refund payment with all required fields
const refundPayment = new Payment({
  patientId: appointment.patientId,
  doctorId: appointment.doctorId,
  appointmentId: appointment._id,
  amount: refundAmount,
  paymentType: 'refund',
  stripeSessionId: `refund_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
  stripePaymentIntentId: `refund_pay_${Date.now()}`,
  status: 'completed',
  paymentDate: new Date(),
  metadata: {
    reason: 'Appointment cancelled more than 3 days in advance',
    refundPercentage: 50,
    originalAmount: consultationFee
  }
});

await refundPayment.save();
```

### What Was Fixed

✅ **Proper Fee Retrieval** - Fetches doctor's actual consultation fee
✅ **All Required Fields** - Payment record has all necessary fields
✅ **Correct Status** - Returns success response after refund creation
✅ **Proper Metadata** - Stores refund details for tracking

### Testing the Fix

**Before:**
```
1. Cancel appointment
2. Error: "Failed to cancel appointment"
3. Appointment cancelled but no refund
4. Frontend shows error
```

**After:**
```
1. Cancel appointment (>3 days notice)
2. Success: "Appointment cancelled. ₹125 (50%) refund processed"
3. Appointment status: 'cancelled_refunded'
4. Refund payment record created
5. Frontend shows success message
```

---

## Feature 3: Payment Failure Simulation ✅

### Problem
- Mock payment always succeeded
- No way to test payment failure scenarios
- Couldn't test error handling

### Solution Implemented

**Added Confirmation Dialog:**
```javascript
// In BookAppointment.jsx
const wantsToSucceed = window.confirm(
  `Simulate payment?\n\n` +
  `Amount: ₹${(order.amount / 100).toFixed(2)}\n` +
  `Doctor: ${selectedDoctor.userId.name}\n\n` +
  `Click OK for SUCCESS\nClick Cancel for FAILURE`
);

if (!wantsToSucceed) {
  // Simulate payment failure
  toast.error('Payment Failed! Please try again.');
  setBooking(false);
  return;
}
```

### How It Works

```
1. User clicks "Proceed to Payment"
2. Order created (no appointment yet)
3. After 1.5 seconds, confirmation dialog appears
4. User chooses:
   - OK → Payment succeeds → Appointment created
   - Cancel → Payment fails → No appointment created
5. Time slot remains available if payment fails
```

### Testing Scenarios

**Success Flow:**
1. Book appointment
2. Click OK in dialog
3. ✅ Payment succeeds
4. ✅ Appointment created
5. ✅ Time slot blocked

**Failure Flow:**
1. Book appointment
2. Click Cancel in dialog
3. ✅ Payment fails
4. ✅ No appointment created
5. ✅ Time slot still available
6. ✅ Can try again
